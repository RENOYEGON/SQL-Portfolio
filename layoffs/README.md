## Dataset Details
This dataset was from the [Layoffs Dataset](https://layoffs.fyi/)
 by Layoffs.fyi. It entails the tech layoffs starting from 11-03-2020 (when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic), to April 2025.

## Project Overview
I prepared the raw dataset through standard cleaning processes, and analyzed the resulting data to identify trends and create insights from it. My main goal was to understand the impact of after COVID-19 till this Year and the distribution of layoffs across the different industries.
