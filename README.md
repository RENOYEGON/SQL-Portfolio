# SQL-Portfolio
Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my SQL projects, showcasing my skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project includes detailed SQL scripts and explanations to demonstrate my approach and methodology.

## Projects 



- **Project: Row Health Targeted Insights**

  - **Description:** This project involved answering key business questions  using SQL. Insights were derived on topics such as the top hair-related products, the states with the most claims, and the most frequent users of the reimbursement program. The data was cleaned, transformed, and merged to create an analysis-ready dataset.

  - **SQL Skills Used:** Data Aggregation, Date Handling , Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Joins, Filtering, Sorting, String Manipulation
Output: Created a clean and structured dataset for Excel analysis by combining three CSV files using SQL transformations.
